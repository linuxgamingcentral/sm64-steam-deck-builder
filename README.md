# Super Mario 64 Steam Deck Builder and Launcher
Super Mario 64 PC port builder and launcher for Steam Deck.

To use the builder, simply right-click the [desktop file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linuxgamingcentral/sm64-steam-deck-builder/main/sm64-builder.desktop), click "Save link as..." and save it to your desktop. Double-click or tap the downloaded file to run it.

SM64 PC port builds are downloaded to the `/home` directory. The builder will ask you to place your legally-dumped ROM in the appopriate folder before the build process takes place. From there, you can launch the game directly through the launcher.
